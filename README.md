# Ninja Forms Paypal Redirect

This Wordpress plugin allows you to add a Paypal redirect to your NF forms.
You simply add the "Paypal redirect" field to your form, specify your hosted button ID and that's it.

One important thing: in order for the redirect to work, the "Action" upon submission should be set to "Success message".

NF is about to get a major upgrade(going from v2.x to v3) soon, so if you use this plugin, be sure to test it out on v3 before updating your NF.

If any issues arise, post here and I'll see what I can do.
